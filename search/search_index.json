The cluster is a shared resource and some wait time, while often short or non-existent, can be expected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your job might be requesting resources that are not currently available. Check the output of <code>squeue -j JobID</code>, where JobID is your SLURM job number. In the output, check the final column '''Nodelist (Reason)'''. You might see '''PD''' followed by a reason why the job is not running. This could indicate that your job is temporarily waiting for resources (see above) or is blocked. The more resources that you request, the higher chance that your job might sit in queue waiting for those resources to become available. Try to limit the amount of resources you request to only the ones you really need.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your job might be blocked by a maintenance window. For details see Job Scheduling and Maintenance.</p> </li> </ul> Can I run a task/script on a login node? <p>Yes, but you should make sure you know exactly how many cores and memory the task will use. Additionally, you should make sure this task will not run for more than 30 min. Examples of allowed tasks might be a pre- or post- processing task for your input/output files. This might also include compiling or installing software. In general, please try to run all computationally intensive tasks on on the cluster compute nodes. For details see the User Etiquette Guide.</p> Can I have root or sudo access on a compute node? <p>No. RCC does not allow root and/or sudo access on any system.</p> What if my job requires more than 7 days? Can I extend my job time? <p>Yes. After you start the job, email the job number and time extension request to help-rcc@mcw.edu.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#software","title":"Software","text":"What software is available on the HPC cluster? <p>You can list all available software on the cluster with the <code>module avail</code> command. See the cluster software guide for details.</p> Can I install my own software? <p>Yes, you may install your own software. The process will vary depending on the type of software. Please contact help-rcc@mcw.edu if you need assistance.</p> Will RCC install my software for me? <p>You may request to have RCC install your software on the cluster. RCC will make a best effort but cannot guarantee that your software will run on the cluster. Please send software installation requests to help-rcc@mcw.edu.</p> How do I install an R package? <p>You can install your own R packages. See the R guide for details. Please also that RCC has centrally installed many packages that are either commonly used, or difficult to install. We suggest to check first if your package is already installed. Please contact help-rcc@mcw.edu for assistance or to have RCC install the package for you.</p> How do I install a Python package? <p>You can install your own Python packages using the system Python, a local Python, a virtual environment, or a conda environment. See the Python guide for details. Please also that RCC has centrally installed many packages that are either commonly used, or difficult to install. We suggest to check first if your package is already installed. Please contact help-rcc@mcw.edu for assistance or to have RCC install the package for you.</p> Can I use Docker on the cluster? <p>No. Docker is not installed or allowed on RCC systems due to security. However, RCC does provide a container solution called Singularity, which can import Docker containers to run on the cluster.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#data-transfer-storage","title":"Data Transfer &amp; Storage","text":"How do I check my available storage directories and utilization? <p>You can easily find your available storage directories and current utilization with the <code>mydisks</code> command.</p> <pre><code>$ mydisks\n======My Lab======\nSize  Used Avail Use% File\n47G   29G   19G  61% /home/user\n932G  158G  774G  17% /group/pi\n4.6T     0  4.6T   0% /scratch/g/pi\n</code></pre> Why does my quota show as less space? <p>Your computer reports storage utilization in base-2 math and the storage system quotas use base-10 math. So, if your quota is 1TB, the <code>mydisks</code> command will show 932GB. Please note that this is a difference in mathematical representation of the same value. While the <code>mydisks</code> command shows less space, you are still able to use your full quota.</p> What types of storage are available? <p>RCC offers multiple types of storage to all users. Each storage type has a unique path on the cluster, and a unique use-case. Some storage is meant only for use with the cluster, while other storage like Research Group Storage can be used as generalized Windows storage. Please see the Storage Overview for details.</p> Can I increase my storage limits? <p>Your home directory limit cannot be increased. You scratch directory limit may be increase upon request but this is subject to availability. Your <code>/group</code> Research Group Storage directory may be increased by purchasing additional space.</p> Why is <code>/group</code> not available on HPC cluster compute nodes? <p>The file system that contains <code>/group</code> is not designed for performance computing. In order to preserve every user's experience with <code>/group</code>, it is not available on compute nodes. You should follow the scratch directory procedures to make sure your data is available to your cluster job.</p> Can I mount my own storage to the cluster? <p>No. RCC provides storage that is mounted to the cluster. This storage is specifically designed to work within the cluster network and meets performance requirements.</p> Where can I store reference data? <p>Reference data will be stored at <code>/hpc/refdata</code> upon request. Please see Reference Data for more information.</p> How do I use my group storage for collaboration outside my lab? <p>Your lab group storage can be used to collaborate with non-lab members. This is done with by-request project directories. For example, if lab <code>pi</code> would like to collaborate with some data for a project called <code>zephyr</code>, then the lab PI would contact RCC to create a project directory.</p> <pre><code>$ ls -l /group/pi\ntotal 8\ndrwxrws---. 3 root sg-pi-zephyr 512 Mar 26 13:52 zephyr\ndrwxrws---. 4 root sg-pi       1024 May 19 14:04 work\n</code></pre> <p>In addition to the usual <code>work</code> directory, there is now a <code>zephyr</code> project directory, which is controlled by the <code>sg-pi-zephyr</code> security group. Project data would go in that directory, and any number of collaborators (MCW researchers) can be added to the security group.</p> Why did my Windows SMB storage share stopped working? <p>Stale connections for Windows shares are not uncommon. If your storage share stopped working, chances are this is a stale connection. This is especially true if the storage was working one day, and you cannot connect the next day. To fix this issue, you'll need to remount the storage with the following steps.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Open Windows File Explorer and right-click on the drive, then select Disconnect.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remount the storage using this guide. In step #4, make sure to select <code>Connect using different credentials</code> during that process. If you are on a non-MCW managed computer, please enter your MCW username with the \"MCWCORP\\\" domain prefix (example MCWCORP\\jsmith).</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"faq/#open-ondemand","title":"Open OnDemand","text":"Why does the Open OnDemand web page not load? <p>Open OnDemand supports most modern browsers. However, there is no IE 11 support. To have the best experience using Open OnDemand, use the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge.</p> How do I fix Open OnDemand if it stops working and shows a <code>Proxy Error</code> web page? <p>The proxy error web page is a common issue that occurs when Open OnDemand is used for a long time without logging out. To diagnose the issue, try an incognito browser session. If that fixes your issue temporarily, proceed to clear your browser cache as a permanent fix.</p> How do I use RStudio on the cluster? <p>Open OnDemand has a built-in RStudio app. You can use this to get a RStudio session on a compute node that you can access via your web browser.</p> How do I get a Jupyter Notebook on the cluster? <p>Open OnDemand has a built-in Jupyter Notebook app. You can use this to get a Jupyter Notebook on a compute node that you can access via your web browser.</p> Can I get a virtual desktop on the cluster? <p>Yes, Open OnDemand does have a virtual desktop app built-in.

Please see the table below for additional examples.</p> Reason Why What to do <code>QOSMaxJobsPerUserLimit</code> You reached the number of running jobs allowed per user for the corresponding partition. You can wait for previous jobs to finish or cancel running jobs. <code>Resources</code> The job is waiting for resources to become available. In many cases you should wait and the job will run. Additionally, try to make sure that you don't request more resources than what you need. <code>Dependency</code> A job dependency is not yet satisfied. You can learn more about job dependencies in our video for creating an advanced SLURM script. <code>Maintenance</code> Your job is blocked until maintenance is finished. You can wait or cancel and resubmit your job according to the job scheduling and maintenance section of our job submission guide. <code>Priority</code> Your job is waiting for higher priority jobs to finish.

By immediately, we mean the job starts and finishes without producing any useful output. Often there is an error listed in the job output file.

Most often we find the job output file is something like <code>slurm-12345.out</code>, where 12345 is the jobId number.</p> <p>Incorrect file names or paths are the most common source of immediate job failure. You will see a specific error in your output file with the syntax <code>command: /file/path: No such file or directory</code>. This indicates that your job is trying to manipulate a file or directory that does not exist. Most often this is a simple typo error, but could also be caused by trying to use files in <code>/group</code>, which is not available on compute nodes. We suggest to double check the file names and paths, and then resubmit. If the issue persists, contact help-rcc@mcw.edu.</p> <p>Storage limits can also cause this issue.

The reason is that the scheduler cannot guarantee your job will finish before maintenance begins.</p> <p>Fixing the issue...</p> <p>To make the job run, resubmit your job with a walltime request that ensures the job will finish before the maintenance window.

Here we'll talk about scratch space, why it exists, and how to use it properly.</p> <p>Overview</p> <p>Scratch space is traditionally the high-performance storage component in any cluster. It's purpose is to hold temporary files generated by running jobs. Many HPC jobs need to write large files, or many files, which are temporary and only used during the job. These files might include checkpoints (incremental save points), intermediate files, etc. These are files that may be needed to diagnose a failed job, but are not kept long term, and are not integral to publishable results.</p> <p>A common question is why do we separate scratch space and general file storage (i.e., /group)? Many users question why, since this may require copying data between storage, and extra data management steps. The simple answer is that high-performance storage is expensive. If we combined the general purpose storage and scratch space workloads into one storage system, some decisions must be made. For example, if the combined storage is all general purpose, the job workloads could crash or severely affect the slower general purpose storage system. Or if the combined space is all high-performance, general file data (which is most of our data) would be a wasted expense.</p> <p>Why talk about scratch space?</p> <p>Most users do not understand or properly use scratch space. We have 215TB of high-performance scratch space and approximately 50-60% is improperly utilized at any given time. Much of this improper use is old files that are not cleaned up or avoiding additional storage charges in <code>/group</code>.</p> <p>Why is this a problem?</p> <p>RCC staff are constantly having to contact users to ask them to clean-up their scratch space. This takes time and effort, and is not very effective. The scratch space remains unnecessarily full, which means new users will not have space to work. Moreover, existing users are forced to make use of a small amount of space, which hurts productivity.</p> <p>Proper use</p> <p>We have a simple workflow to follow:</p> <ol> <li>User copies job input/supporting files from an RGS directory within /group/{PI_NetID}/... to their scratch directory /scratch/g/{PI_NetID}</li> <li>User submits job that computes with the staged job input/supporting files</li> <li>Job finishes and user copies results from /scratch/g/{PI_NetID} back to /group/{PI_NetID}/...</li> <li>User continues with further computations with the job input/supporting files</li> <li>User finishes computations and deletes unneeded job input/supporting files from /scratch/g/{PI_NetID}</li> </ol> <p>Summary</p> <p>Try to remember that scratch space is shared. Proper use of scratch space benefits all users. So, clean up your scratch space by following a simple rule; when not running jobs, your scratch should be empty!</p>"},{"location":"news/2023/08/29/september-maintenance/","title":"September maintenance","text":""},{"location":"news/2023/08/29/september-maintenance/#september-maintenance","title":"September maintenance","text":"<p>RCC maintenance will last from 9PM-12AM on Wednesday, September 6, 2023.

For instance, a daily snapshot will capture all changes made in the previous 24-hour period, for files present at the time of the next snapshot. That last point is important. The timing of snapshots will determine what is and is not captured. For example, if you create and delete a file within the same 24-hour period, then the file will not be present for any snapshot. In that case you will not have any snapshot version of that particular file.

However, because of the short notice, this new rate will apply only to new storage subscription payments made in 2025. All existing storage renewals processed in January 2025 will remain at the current rate of $60/TB/year.</p> <p>In FY22, RCC added replication storage to provide vital data protections for all group storage directories. This enhancement effectively doubled the cost of storage. At that time, RCC chose not to increase price until the end of the original storage lifetime. Now, as we work to renew and expand storage, we must adjust pricing to maintain a sustainable service for research. The new pricing structure will be implemented 2025-2027 as follows:</p> <p>2025 - $80/TB/year 2026 - $100/TB/year 2027 - $120/TB/year</p> <p>We understand that some investigators may question if replication can be optional to reduce cost.

Never install things into /home, /tmp, or any other directories that are bound at runtime. <code>%runscript</code> This section is executed when the container is run via the <code>apptainer run</code> command or by executing the container directly as a command. Any arguments passed to the container will be processed in this section. We can use here variables set in<code>%environment</code> or <code>%post</code>. <code>%test</code> This section runs at the end of the build process to validate the container using a method of your choice. <code>%labels</code> You can add metadata in this section with name-value format such as <code>Author Me</code> or <code>Version v1.0</code>. <code>%help</code> Use this section to explain to the user how to interact with the container. <p>Full documentation of definition files at Apptainer Docs.</p> <p>Examples of definition files: Apptainer examples.</p>"},{"location":"software/containers/#build","title":"Build","text":"<p>Build the container using the definition file:</p> <pre><code>sudo apptainer build py_container.sif py_container.def\n</code></pre> <p>The syntax is always <code>apptainer build</code> followed by the new container name, denoted by the <code>.sif</code> extension, and the corresponding definition file.</p> <p>root or sudo required</p> <p>Building from a definition file requires <code>root</code> or <code>sudo</code> permissions.

Also, using conda will allow you to create different environments for specific software and share them with other people. For example, one program that you might need can have certain dependencies that conflict with the dependencies of another program. You can solve this by using different conda environments.

Each lab receives 1 TB for free and can expand via additional paid storage. This space is large scale, but low performance. It is not meant for high I/O, and so is not mounted to compute nodes. Data protection includes replication and snapshots. For more info on snapshots, and how you might recover a file, please see file recovery.</p> <p>This space is organized by lab group. Each folder in <code>/group</code> represents a lab, and is named using the PI's NetID (username). For example, a PI with username \"jsmith\" would have a group directory located at <code>/group/jsmith</code>. Directories within that lab space are organized by purpose and controlled by unique security groups. For example, there is a default <code>/group/pi_netid/work</code> directory, which is shared space restricted to lab users. Other shared directories can be created by request for projects that require unique permissions. Additionally, you may have data directories related to your use of a MCW core. These directories will be named for the core and located at <code>/group/pi_netid/cores</code>.

We also maintain support contracts for all storage with provisions for prompt hardware replacement. In addition, some file systems have additional protection.</p> <p>Home directories and research group storage, i.e., <code>/group/pi_netid</code>, are protected by snapshots and replication. Replication occurs via two identical storage systems located in our two data centers. Replication occurs every minute (continuously), with changes in the primary file system sent to the target file system. These changes might include new files, edits, deletions, etc. Replication is a disaster recovery measure, protecting against the loss of a full file system. Since all data changes are replicated, it does not protect against accidental or unintended edits, overwrites, deletions, etc.</p> <p>To protect against these unintended changes, we use snapshots. The granularity of snapshots determines which of these changes are captured. It is not guaranteed that all changes will be captured by snapshots, and therefore recoverable. For instance, we keep 14 daily and 6 weekly snapshots. If an unintended change is caught by the snapshot, i.e. you delete a file that has been on the file system for more than 24 hrs, you may be able to recover it. However, snapshots may miss changes that occur within 24 hrs. For instance, if you create and delete a file before the daily snapshot can capture a version of the file, then it would not be recoverable.</p> <p>Disclaimer</p> <p>Research Computing is not responsible for any loss of data.
