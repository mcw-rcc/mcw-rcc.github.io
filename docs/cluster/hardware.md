# Overview

The HPC environment became available to MCW researchers in March 2021. The cluster consists of **79** compute nodes, **4,200** CPU cores, and **96** GPUs. The cluster is connected by **7** 100 Gbps switches running RoCEv2 (ethernet equivalent to Infiniband). Additionally, a **467 TB** NVMe provides scratch storage, and a **2.6 PB** scale-out NAS provides persistent storage.
