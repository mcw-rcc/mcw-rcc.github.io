# Open OnDemand

**Open OnDemand** is a web browser-based interface to RCC computing resources. You can manage files, submit and monitor jobs, and run pre-configured interactive apps such as Jupyter and RStudio. All of this is possible without logging in via a traditional SSH terminal.

## Documentation

This documentation is specific for RCC's Open OnDemand instance. Open OnDemand was created by the [Ohio Supercomputer Center](https://www.osc.edu/){:target="_blank"}, which provides [full documentation](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/){:target="_blank"}.

## Connecting to Open OnDemand

!!! important "Browser Support"
    No IE 11 support. To have the best experience using Open OnDemand, use the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge.

### On Campus

To connect to Open OnDemand point your browser to <https://ondemand.rcc.mcw.edu>{:target="_blank"}. Open OnDemand is configured to use your MCW username and password. Access does require you have an RCC user account.

After login, the *Dashboard* will appear. The menu includes apps to manage files, submit jobs, monitor jobs, open a terminal session, or launch interactive apps. To end your session, click **Log Out** at the top right.

### Off Campus

Open OnDemand is available for remote work through Citrix. Please see the [remote access guide](remote-access.md) for details.

To access Open OnDemand, point your Citrix web browser to <https://ondemand.rcc.mcw.edu>{:target="_blank"}.

## Command-line Terminal

Open OnDemand includes a command-line terminal app that connects you to the HPC cluster login node via SSH. From the **Dashboard** menu, select **Clusters > Cluster Shell Access** A new window will open and you will be logged in to a cluster login node. This shell access is the same as if you had used a Terminal app from your desktop (i.e. Putty, SSH Secure Shell, MobaXterm, etc.).

!!! tip "The shell app now supports themes!"
    You can customize the them of your OOD shell by selecting a new option from the themes drop-down menu in the upper right-hand corner of the window.

!!! warning "Logout!"
    When you are done with your shell, please logout with the `exit` or `quit` commands.

## File Management

The **Files** menu contains links to common storage locations. Clicking one of the file links opens the **File Explorer** in a new browser tab.

| Button      | Function                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Open in Terminal` | Open current directory in a terminal window in a new browser tab |
| `New File` | Create a new, empty file |
| `New Directory` | Create a new directory |
| `Upload` | Upload a file from your local machine |
| `Download` | Download selected file to your local machine |
| `Copy/Move` | Copy selected file to clipboard |
| `Delete` | Delete selected file |
| `Show Owner/Mode` | Toggle the display of owner and permission settings |
| `Show Dotfiles` | Toggle the display of dotfiles (files starting by a ., which are usually hidden) |
| `Filter` | Filter files/folders by pattern |

Each file and folder will have additional options. Select the `â‹®` dropdown menu to rename, download, delete, view (file only), or edit (file only) a single item.

### Upload a File

To upload a file, select the **Upload** button. Then use the file selector to choose a file to upload. Please note that this only works for individual files. If you need to upload a folder, see [Upload a Folder](#upload-a-folder).

### Upload a Folder

#### On-Campus

To upload a folder, drag and drop the folder from your local desktop to your OnDemand Files app browser window. As you drag the folder to the window, your cursor should show a copy indicator.

#### Off-Campus

If you're off-campus, you'll be accessing OnDemand via Citrix browser. To upload a folder, drag and drop the folder from your Windows File Explorer (Citrix app) to your OnDemand Files app (Citrix browser window). Again, as you drag the folder to the window, your cursor should show a copy indicator.

## Job Submission

Jobs can be created, submitted, and monitored via the Jobs Menu. This is an alternative to creating and submitting job scripts in the command line.

From the **Dashboard** menu, select **Jobs > Job Composer** which will open in a new window. The **Job Composer** app has two tabs: **Jobs** and **Templates** The **Jobs** tab contains a list of all jobs previously submitted through Open OnDemand. The **Templates** tab allows you to create your own job templates.

Jobs can be created from previous jobs or job templates. See [OSC's Job Management Guide](https://www.osc.edu/resources/online_portals/ondemand/job_management){:target="_blank"} for more information.

### Create a New Job

In the **Job Composer** app, select the **Jobs** tab. To create a new job script, click the **+ New Job** button and select **From Default Template** You'll see a new job script entry with status **Not Submitted**. On the right hand side you'll see the **Job Details**, including the location and name of the job script.

#### Edit a Job Script

The default job template creates a new generic job script. You'll need to edit this job script so that it contains the workflow you'll submit to the cluster. To edit a job script, click the **Open Editor** button at the lower right.

This will open a job editor in a new tab. You should write your job script following the normal SLURM job syntax. For information on writing SLURM job scripts, see the [Job Script Guide](../jobs/running-jobs.md#writing-a-job-script). After editing the job script, save the script and close the editor window.

#### Edit job options

Click the blue **Job Options** button. Here you can change the job name and the cluster where the job will run. Click **Save** or **Back** to close the job options window.

### Submit a Job

To submit a job, select a job and click the green **Submit** button. A message at the top of the window will indicate if the job submission was successful or not. After job submission, the job status will change to **Queued** or **Running** When the job completes, the status will show **Completed**

### Monitor Jobs

From the **Dashboard** menu, select **Jobs > Active Jobs** for a live view of the cluster queue. You can view all jobs, your own jobs, and select by cluster.

## Interactive Applications

Open OnDemand features several interactive applications that run on cluster nodes and are accessed through the web interface. This allows you to run interactive apps directly in your web browser.

!!! tip "GUI Apps"
    Some Open OnDemand apps require a Graphical User Interface (GUI). One example is the **Remote Desktop** app. When starting a GUI app, you can select **Compression** and **Image Quality** settings before connecting. Most sessions will run best with minimum compression and maximum image quality. If you have a slow network connection, you can maximize compression and minimize image quality.

### Jupyter Notebook Example

Here we focus on the Jupyter Notebook app as a popular example, but there are many apps to choose from. Check the [full app list](https://ondemand.rcc.mcw.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sessions){:target="_blank"} for details.

To start a Jupyter Notebook on a cluster server:

1. From the **Dashboard** menu, select **Interactive Apps > Jupyter Notebook**. You'll see two categories in the **Interactive Apps** drop-down menu. Select for the resource you need.
2. The **My Interactive Sessions** screen will open. Select for the resource parameters that you need. You can also select to be notified by email when your session will start.  
![Jupyter notebook app](../../_static/img/Jupyter_notebook_app.png)  
3. Click the **Launch** button to start your Jupyter Notebook session. You may have to wait for cluster resources to become available.
4. Once the session starts, click the **Connect to Jupyter** button. A Jupyter Notebook will open in a new window.  
![Jupyter notebook app](../../_static/img/Jupyter_notebook_app_launch.png)  
5. To terminate your Jupyter Notebook session, go back to the **My Interactive Sessions** page and click the red **Delete** button.

!!! tip "Did you know you can also use your own Python environment in your Jupyter Notebook session?"
    If you have installed a Python environment in your home directory, then you can generate a Jupyter kernel which can then be used in your Jupyter Notebook session.

    ```bash
    # login to the cluster and run the following, replacing myenv with the name of your Python env
    $ source activate myenv
    $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"
    ```

## Known Issues

### Proxy Error

If you use Open OnDemand for long periods without logging out, you may see a `Proxy Error` web page. To diagnose the issue, try an [incognito browser session](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop). If that fixes your issue temporarily, proceed to [clear your browser cache](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) as a permanent fix. To prevent this issue, logout of Open OnDemand at the end of each day when you finish working.
