# Remote Access

Off-campus access to RCC resources is dependent on MCW-IS standard remote access methods. For more information on remote work, see [Remote Work Guide](https://infoscope.mcw.edu/is/virtual.htm){:target="_blank"}. RCC resources are available remotely using Citrix.

## Citrix

Citrix is the recommended method of remote access to RCC resources. Citrix is available off-campus using MFA for login.

### PuTTY in Citrix

[PuTTY](putty.md) is a well-documented terminal application used for SSH access to Linux systems. Contact the MCW-IS help desk to request PuTTY for your Citrix account.

To access PuTTY, first login to Citrix. From the Citrix home page, select **Admin Tools**, then select **PuTTY**.

### Open OnDemand in Citrix

Use the web browser in Citrix to access RCC's Open OnDemand service. This is a web-portal for utilizing our HPC resources. This access includes file browsing, SSH access, job management, etc. For more information, please see [Open OnDemand](ondemand.md).

To access Open OnDemand, first login to Citrix. From the Citrix home page, select **Browsers**, and select your Citrix web browser of choice. Open OnDemand is most stable in **Google Chrome**.
