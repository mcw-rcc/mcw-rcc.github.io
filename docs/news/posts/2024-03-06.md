# Storage policy change postponed

RCC is postponing the [scratch storage policy changes](2024-01-02.md) that were supposed to take effect today, March 6, 2024 due to technical issues and lack of compliance.

<!-- more -->

We currently have more than 59TB of data in user scratch directories. We also suspect, based on sampling, that much of the data in group scratch folders has not been accessed or modified in more than 60 days. This means that, according to these policy changes, RCC would have deleted at least 59TB of data, and probably closer to 100TB. We do not wish to delete ongoing research data and cause harm to any individual’s research program. Therefore, RCC will postpone these policy changes.

We will communicate further updates and a new schedule very soon. In the meantime, we require that you work towards compliance with these policies. This means that user scratch directories should be emptied, and any group scratch files not modified or accessed in previous 60 days should be deleted. Compliance with these policies is vitally important so that we can continue to support new initiatives and workloads within the RCC environment.
