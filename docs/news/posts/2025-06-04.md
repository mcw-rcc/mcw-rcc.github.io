# New GPU nodes available

Two new GPU nodes are now available. Each new node has 128 cores, 750 GB of memory, 8 L40S GPUs, and a 7 TB local scratch disk. The new GPU nodes are part of the `gpu` partition and no special job configuration is needed. Please see the [SLURM guide](../../cluster/jobs/running-jobs.md) for details.
