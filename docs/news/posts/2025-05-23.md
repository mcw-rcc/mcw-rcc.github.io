# Scratch storage is full

The scratch storage system is currently **95% full**, leaving very little space for new jobs. This is a **shared resource**, and without action from users, **jobs will begin to fail**.

!!! danger "Possible data deletion"
    If the system does become 100% full, Research Computing admins will begin deleting data without notice.

<!-- more -->

**Who This Applies To**:

* We are sending this email to all users. However, **we only require action by users with data in /scratch on the cluster**. If you have run a job on the cluster, this likely applies to you.

**What You Need To Do**:

* **If you are not actively running a job or do not plan to run one within the next 7 days, please remove your data from /scratch immediately**.
* This includes any temporary or intermediate files that are no longer needed for current or near-term jobs.

**Important Reminders**:

* /scratch is **not** intended for long-term research data storage.
* It is reserved solely for data used by jobs currently running or starting soon.
* If your project is between runs, please clear your /scratch space to make room for others.
* **If the system does become 100% full, Research Computing admins will begin deleting data without notice.**

**Optional Support**:

* For guidance on proper use of scratch space, please see our [documentation](../../cluster/jobs/storage-job.md).
* If you prefer that Research Computing staff clear all of your /scratch data, email {{ support_email }}.

Thank you for your cooperation in helping maintain a productive shared environment.
