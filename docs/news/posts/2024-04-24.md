# Final cluster OS upgrade phase

RCC is in the second phase of a plan to upgrade the cluster operating system to Rocky Linux 8. We have answered a number of great questions and fixed a number of issues since the upgrade. We have also seen several weeks of stability, and so have decided to end this phase earlier than planned. To that end, RCC will upgrade the remaining systems on **May 1**. Please send any questions/concerns to {{ support_email }}.
