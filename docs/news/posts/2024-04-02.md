# April maintenance

RCC maintenance will last from **9PM-12AM on Wednesday, April 3, 2024**. Cluster jobs will be blocked during maintenance. Login nodes will be rebooted. Open OnDemand will be rebooted. Access to storage may be disrupted. Most login and compute nodes will be upgraded to Rocky Linux 8.

!!! warning "Potentially breaking change"
    RCC will upgrade a majority of login and cluster nodes to Rocky Linux 8. If you have not participated in the first phase test, you are at risk of failing, or inaccurate jobs. We will continue to maintain a login node and small number of cluster nodes on the legacy CentOS 7 operating system. This will ensure backwards compatibility for those users that have not fixed software issues prior to upgrade. Contact {{ support_email }} with questions.
