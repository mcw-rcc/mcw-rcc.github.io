# New GPU nodes available

Two new GPU nodes are now available. Each new node has 48 cores, 480GB of memory, 4 A40 GPUs, and a 3.84TB local scratch disk. Along with this addition, weâ€™ve increased account and user limits for GPU utilization.

The new GPU nodes are part of the `gpu` partition. No additional configuration is needed. Please see the [SLURM guide](../../cluster/jobs/running-jobs.md) for details.
