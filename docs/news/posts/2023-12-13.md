# HPC Cluster Operating System Upgrade

The HPC cluster operating system, CentOS 7, will be end-of-life in June 2024 and we are beginning a project to upgrade. This will allow us to maintain ongoing security patching and compatibility with new software through the cluster lifetime. To that end, we have chosen to upgrade the HPC cluster to Rocky Linux 8.
