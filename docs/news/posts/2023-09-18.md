# New cluster software list available

We hope you enjoy the new [cluster software list](../../software/software-list.md). This list will be regularly updated when new software is installed on the cluster. It uses a semi-automated process to read data from our modulefiles, which we then transform to a usable yaml format. We hope to add new lists for other package systems such as R. Please let us know if that is of interest.
