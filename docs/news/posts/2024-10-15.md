# Storage price increase in 2025

Starting in 2025, the price for group storage will increase to $80/TB/year. However, because of the short notice, this new rate will apply only to new storage subscription payments made in 2025. All existing storage renewals processed in January 2025 will remain at the current rate of $60/TB/year.

<!-- more -->

In FY22, RCC added replication storage to provide vital data protections for all group storage directories. This enhancement effectively doubled the cost of storage. At that time, RCC chose not to increase price until the end of the original storage lifetime. Now, as we work to renew and expand storage, we must adjust pricing to maintain a sustainable service for research. The new pricing structure will be implemented 2025-2027 as follows:

**2025 - $80/TB/year**  
**2026 - $100/TB/year**  
**2027 - $120/TB/year**

We understand that some investigators may question if replication can be optional to reduce cost. However, due to the nature of our storage solution, replication must be universal and cannot be optional. Research Computing will re-evaluate storage pricing again in FY27 to account for changing needs and functionality.

Summary:

- Storage renewals in January 2025 will be at the current rate of $60/TB/year.
- All new (non-renewal) storage subscriptions in 2025 will be charged at the 2025 rate of $80/TB/year.
- Starting in 2026, both renewals and new subscriptions will be charged at the respective yearly rates shown above.
