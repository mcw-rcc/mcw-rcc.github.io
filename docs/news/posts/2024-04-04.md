# Cluster operating system upgrade

RCC is entering the second phase of a planned upgrade of the cluster operating system to Rocky Linux 8. Last night, the majority of login and cluster nodes were upgraded and now run Rocky Linux 8. A single login node and select compute nodes running CentOS 7 are still available via special queues. This will ensure backwards compatibility for those users that have not fixed software issues prior to upgrade. Please note, if you did not participate in the first phase test, your jobs may be at risk of failing, or inaccuracy.  Contact {{ support_email }} with questions.
