# New Open OnDemand App

Research Computing has upgraded Open OnDemand with a new [Open Job Composer](https://ondemand.rcc.mcw.edu/pun/sys/open_job_composer/Slurm) app; a simpler, more powerful way to create and submit SLURM jobs.

The new app replaces the old Job Composer and makes it easy to:

- Write and submit jobs with the right resources
- Handle simple, array, and parallel jobs
- Generate a job script in real time
- Quickly access job history and related files

This app was customized by Research Computing to fit MCW's needs, but the primary developer is the RIKEN Center for Computational Science in Japan. You can start using Open Job Composer today and links for additional help are provided within the app.
