# Paid Additional Storage

## Overview

Additional `/group/pi_netid` storage is available through a paid Research Group Storage (RGS) subscription.

## Subscription Cost

The cost is $60/TiB/year. All fees must be prepaid. Minimum subscription size is 1TiB. Minimum subscription duration is 1 year or the number of months until the start of the next calendar year. RGS subscriptions are based on calendar year (January 1 to December 31). Subscriptions purchased in mid-year will be charged a prorated fee according to the number of months until January 1. RCC will not refund RGS fees for any reason.

## Unpaid Fees

If RGS fees are unpaid, RCC admins will change your storage directory to **read-only** (i.e. no new data can be written). The PI will have until March 31 to pay any fees that are due or move the data off of RGS.

## Ownership

The RGS service is a subscription-based lease of storage space for a finite duration. RCC retains ownership of all hardware associated with RGS.

## Availability

Storage availability is not guaranteed. Requests for subscription greater than 50TiB will require RCC review.

## Sign-up & Payment

A RCC account is required for RGS. If you do not already have an RCC account, [submit a request](https://forms.office.com/r/98QNm6cAyt){:target="_blank"}. RCC will then process your account and provision the storage. If you are not a PI, your PI must also have an RCC account.

Payment can be made through the MCW-IS service desk website using the following guide.

1. Proceed to <https://servicedesk.mcw.edu>{:target="_blank"} and login.
2. Select **Software > RCC Software**, then **Research Group Storage - 1TiB**.
3. To pay for 1TiB, select **Add to Cart**. If you are paying for multiple TiBs, select **Add Multiple** and enter the quantity.
4. Select **Place Your Order** and enter your 16-17 Digit Account Number.
5. Finally, you'll be asked to enter PI information. Use this if you're a non-PI requesting the storage on behalf of a PI.
