# Paid Additional Storage

## Overview

Additional research group storage, i.e., `/group/PI_NetID`, is available through a paid subscription.

## Cost

The 2025 rate is $80/TB/year. All fees must be prepaid and minimum addition is 1 TB. Minimum duration is 1 year (January 1 to December 31), or the number of months until the start of the next calendar year. Fees will be prorated according to the number of months until December 31. Research Computing will not refund storage fees for any reason.

!!! info "Storage price increases"
    The price of storage will increase incrementally starting in 2025 and beyond. The pricing schedule is as follows:

    2025 - $80/TB/year  
    2026 - $100/TB/year  
    2027 - $120/TB/year
    
    RCC will re-evaluate storage pricing in FY27 and welcome your feedback on this issue. For more information, please see our [recent news post about storage price changes](../news/posts/2024-10-15.md).

## Unpaid Fees

If fees are unpaid, RCC admins will change your research group storage directory to **read-only** (i.e. no new data can be written). The PI will have until March 31 to pay any fees that are due or remove the data.

## Ownership

This storage service is a subscription-based lease of storage space for a finite duration. RCC retains ownership of all hardware associated with this service.

## Availability

Storage availability is not guaranteed. Requests greater than 50 TB will require review. Please contact {{ support_email }} to inquire.
