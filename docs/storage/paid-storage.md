# Paid Additional Storage

## Overview

Additional `/group/PI_NetID` storage is available through a paid Research Group Storage (RGS) subscription.

## Subscription Cost

The 2024 rate is $60/TB/year. All fees must be prepaid. Minimum subscription size is 1 TB. Minimum subscription duration is 1 year or the number of months until the start of the next calendar year. RGS subscriptions are based on calendar year (January 1 to December 31). Subscriptions purchased in mid-year will be charged a prorated fee according to the number of months until January 1. RCC will not refund RGS fees for any reason.

!!! info "Storage price increases"
    The price of storage will increase incrementally starting in 2025 and beyond. The pricing schedule is as follows:

    2025 - $80/TB/year  
    2026 - $100/TB/year  
    2027 - $120/TB/year
    
    RCC will re-evaluate storage pricing in FY27 and welcome your feedback on this issue. For more information, please see our [recent news post about storage price changes](../news/posts/2024-10-15.md).

## Unpaid Fees

If RGS fees are unpaid, RCC admins will change your storage directory to **read-only** (i.e. no new data can be written). The PI will have until March 31 to pay any fees that are due or move the data off of RGS.

## Ownership

The RGS service is a subscription-based lease of storage space for a finite duration. RCC retains ownership of all hardware associated with RGS.

## Availability

Storage availability is not guaranteed. Requests for subscription greater than 50 TB will require RCC review.

## Sign-up & Payment

A RCC account is required for RGS. If you do not already have an RCC account, [submit a request](https://forms.office.com/r/98QNm6cAyt){:target="_blank"}. RCC will then process your account and provision the storage. If you are not a PI, your PI must also have an RCC account.

Payment can be made through the MCW-IS service desk website using the following guide.

1. Proceed to <https://servicedesk.mcw.edu>{:target="_blank"} and login.
2. Select **Software > RCC Software**, then **Research Group Storage - 1TB**.
3. To pay for 1 TB, select **Add to Cart**. If you are paying for multiple TBs, select **Add Multiple** and enter the quantity.
4. Select **Place Your Order** and enter your 16-17 Digit Account Number.
5. Finally, you'll be asked to enter PI information. Use this if you're a non-PI requesting the storage on behalf of a PI.
