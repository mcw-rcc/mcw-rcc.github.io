# Storage Overview

Research Computing provides storage with a dedicated purpose to hold and support analysis of raw research data. Every MCW lab is eligible for a limited amount of free storage. For many labs, this amount of free storage is sufficient for their research. For labs with large data needs, additional storage is available for fee.

All storage is connected via high speed link to the cluster and available to you via Linux command-line, SFTP, or Open OnDemand.

Each user has the same set of default storage paths:

| Type                  | Path                | Quota                          | Protection            | Description                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| [`Home`](#home)       | /home/netid         | 100 GiB                        | snapshot, replication | account configuration and scripts |
| [`Group`](#group)     | /group/pi_netid     | 1 TiB, expandable with payment | snapshot, replication | shared raw research data          |
| [`Scratch`](#scratch) | /scratch/g/pi_netid | 5 TiB                          | none                  | temporary job files               |

??? tip "You can easily find your available storage paths and current utilization on the cluster  with the `mydisks` command."

    ```bash
    $ mydisks
    =====My Lab=====
    Size  Used Avail Use% File
    47G   29G   19G  61% /home/user
    932G  158G  774G  17% /group/pi
    4.6T     0  4.6T   0% /scratch/g/pi
    ```

## Storage Paths

### Home

The home directory is your starting place every time you login to the cluster. It's location is `/home/netid`, where `netid` is your MCW username. The purpose of a home directory is storing user-installed software, user-written scripts, configuration files, etc. Each home directory is only accessible by its owner and is not suitable for data sharing. Home is also not appropriate for large scale research data or temporary job files.

The quota limit is 100GiB and data protection includes replication[^1] and snapshots[^2]. For more info on snapshots, and how you might recover a file, please see [file recovery](file-recovery.md).

### Group

Group storage is a shared space for labs to store research data in active projects. Each lab receives 1TiB for free, with [additional storage](../storage/paid-storage.md) available for $60/TiB/year. This space is large scale, but low performance. It is not meant for high I/O, and so is not mounted to compute nodes. Data protection includes replication[^1] and snapshots[^3]. For more info on snapshots, and how you might recover a file, please see [file recovery](file-recovery.md).

This space is organized by lab group. Each folder in `/group` represents a lab, and is named using the PI's NetID (username). For example, a PI with username "jsmith" would have a group directory located at `/group/jsmith`. Directories within that lab space are organized by purpose and controlled by unique security groups. For example, there is a default `/group/pi_netid/work` directory, which is shared space restricted to lab users. Other shared directories can be created by request for projects that require unique permissions. Additionally, you may have data directories related to your use of a MCW core. These directories will be named for the core and located at `/group/pi_netid/cores`. For example, a Mellowes Center project could be delivered to your group storage and located at `/group/pi_netid/cores/mellowes/example_project1`.

### Scratch

Scratch storage is intended for temporary job files. Every group has a directory at `/scratch/g/pi_netid` with quota limit 5 TiB. Files on scratch storage are subject to retention limits, which is discussed below. In general, you should avoid storing files on scratch unless you are running a job. Please remember that scratch storage is limited and shared among all groups.

#### Retention

Any file that has not been accessed or modified for 60 days will be automatically marked for deletion by a process that runs daily. Files marked for deletion are moved to a daily trash folder. Any trash folder older than 14 days will be automatically deleted. This means that the scratch file system will be cleaned up every day, and you will have the opportunity to retrieve those old files for an additional 14 days.

!!! warning "Scratch storage is temporary."

    Do not use scratch storage for long-term project data. If you are not running a job, you should not have any data in scratch. Failure to adhere to this policy may result in loss of your data located on scratch.

### Local Scratch

Every compute node has a local scratch space to be used for runtime files. Each job will have a unique folder that appears as `/tmp`, which is only accessible to processes within the SLURM job. Please note, this space is cleaned (data deleted) after each of your jobs.

Local scratch may be the fastest option to store your job runtime files, especially for jobs that are heavily I/O dependent (i.e. lots of files are read/written). However, the speed of the disk should be weighed against the additional time to transfer files from your global scratch directory.

All compute nodes have 440GiB of local scratch storage, except as noted below.

!!! tip "Some GPU nodes have more local scratch."

    Compute nodes gn07 and gn08 have 17TiB of local storage and gn09 has 7TiB. These nodes are intended for large scale AI jobs that require local fast storage.

## Permissions

Every lab storage path will have an associated security group consisting of the PI and additional users that the PI adds. We require two points of contact that are authorized to request permissions changes. The PI will serve as one point of contact and will provide an alternate. Any group permission changes must come from the PI or alternate. ***Requests must be made through the MCW ticketing system.***

## Restrictions

The following types of data are strictly prohibited on Research Computing systems:

- Any data that would violate the MCW Code of Conduct, MCW Corporate Polices, or any applicable data-use agreement (i.e. IRB, federal grant regulations, etc.)

- Any data that is subject to HIPAA

## Data Protection

All Research Computing storage systems are highly resilient, allowing for multiple disk and server failures without losing data. We also maintain support contracts for all storage with provisions for prompt hardware replacement. In addition, some file systems have additional protection via replication and snapshots.

!!! info "Disclaimer"
    Research Computing is not responsible for any loss of data. We strongly encourage all users to follow best practice data management strategies.

[^1]: Replication copies all data from the primary system to a secondary system in another data center.
[^2]: Home snapshots - 14 daily @ 12PM, 6 weekly @ 1PM Sunday
[^3]: Group snapshots - 14 daily @ 2PM, 6 weekly @ 3PM Sunday
