# Remote Access

Off-campus access to RCC resources is dependent on MCW-IS standard remote access methods. For more information on remote work, see [Remote Work Guide](https://infoscope.mcw.edu/is/virtual.htm){:target="_blank"}. RCC resources are available remotely using Citrix.

## Citrix

Citrix is the recommended method of remote access to RCC resources. Citrix is available off-campus using MFA for login.

### Open OnDemand in Citrix

Use the web browser in Citrix to access RCC's Open OnDemand service. This is a web-portal for utilizing our HPC resources. This access includes file browsing, SSH access, job management, etc. For more information, please see [Open OnDemand](ondemand.md).

To access Open OnDemand, first login to Citrix. From the Citrix home page, select **Browsers**, and select your Citrix web browser of choice. Open OnDemand is most stable in **Google Chrome**. Then, point your Citrix web browser to <https://ondemand.rcc.mcw.edu>.

For a detailed guide on how to connect to onDemand off campus without a VPN, please watch this video: [how to connect to on demand off campus](https://mcw0.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/RCCAdminSite/EfXDm8gXht9PvYueoig7SSgBCTEm7i6WT29zqZF7nM9oIQ?e=1vikFK).

### PuTTY in Citrix

[PuTTY](putty.md) is a well-documented terminal application used for SSH access to Linux systems. Contact the MCW-IS help desk to request PuTTY for your Citrix account.

Once you have PuTTY added to your citrix and to access it, first login to Citrix. From the Citrix home page, select **Admin Tools**, then select **PuTTY**. You can also watch this video on [how to access PuTTY off campus](https://mcw0.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/RCCAdminSite/EbyTZSUepX9DvlstxkTeT2sByG-OoNDAr_MzqtprvcP-Cg?e=gnZWJR).
