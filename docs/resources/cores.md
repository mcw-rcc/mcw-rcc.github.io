# RCC support for cores

Many MCW shared resources (cores) partner with Research Computing for storage, computing, and support. In some cases, we work directly with the core to facilitate streamlined communication and enhanced delivery of services. You'll find examples below of cores that we have already partnered with to deliver services. If you do not see your core, or have questions about how to get started, please contact {{ support_email }}.

## Overview

Our goal is to simplify computing and data management for cores and investigators. While this is unique for every core, the simplest workflow is to collect, process, and deliver data to the investigator without leaving the RCC environment. This removes the need for investigators to transfer data to/from RCC. It also simplifies the core's responsibility for data delivery and retention, i.e., data delivery is fast and the PI becomes responsbile for the data immediately.

These partnerships will continue to evolve and we hope to see more cores listed below. If you're a core administrator and you're not convinced, please our case study done with the Mellowes Center. If you're a user, please check the listed cores for details on how to proceed. Again, if you do not see your core, or have questions about how to get started, please contact {{ support_email }}.

## Cores

### Mellowes Center

Mellowes Center (MC) service lines produce data products that can be delivered to your lab group storage `/group/pi_netid/cores/mellowes/example_project1`. To use this option, select "Deliver to my RCC storage" in iLab. You will be asked to confirm that you have sufficient space. **Do not skip this step!**. If you do not have sufficient open space, MC will not be able to deliver your data in a timely fashion.

If you need additional space, please see the [paid storage](../storage/paid-storage.md#sign-up--payment) guide for details on payment.
