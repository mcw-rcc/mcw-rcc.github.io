# Accounts & Projects

ResHPC access is based on projects. Each project corresponds to a protected dataset with a unique Data Use Agreement (DUA). For example, a PI may request a project to analyze a dbGaP dataset, with access determined by their original dbGaP DUA. Please note that only a MCW PI may establish a project.

!!! important "one DUA, one project"
    Each ResHPC project is specific to a single DUA. If you have more than one DUA, you will need a separate project for each.

## Project ID

Each ResHPC project is identified within the environment by a unique project ID beginning with the letter **p** followed by a unique 4-digit code.

## Project User Account

ResHPC access requires a project user account, which is an extension of your MCW NetID (username) account. For example, you may be a member of project **p1234**, with project user account **jsmith.p1234**. For login, the project user account uses the same password and Duo 2FA authentication as the MCW NetID (**jsmith** in our example).

Multiple users may have access to the same project, each with their own unique project user account (i.e. **jsmith.p1234**, **bstevens.p1234**, **mbradley.p1234**). A MCW investigator may also be a member of multiple projects, with multiple corresponding project user accounts (i.e. **jsmith.p1234**, **jsmith.p2345**, **jsmith.p3456**).

## Project Access

Project access and accounts are based on the project's DUA. For example, access to a project working with dbGaP data will only be granted to users that are part of the dbGaP DUA.

To add a user to a project, first you must amend the DUA to include this user. Consult the data provider and/or MCW Grants & Contracts for details.

## Getting an Account

We strongly suggest to email {{ support_email }} prior to requesting or signing a DUA for a new dataset. Research Computing will not guarantee that ResHPC is suitable for your dataset.
